So basically what I want to do is find a free alternative to AAA(Advanced Aircraft Analysis) that can provide me the stability derivatives given the geometry of aircraft as input. Looking for different softwares I stumbled upon datcom but I don’t Дассо «Рафаль» (фр.

Recently I've started to use finite element and hand calc methods to analyze composites, but I don't have any formal training in this area and was hoping some of you can point me in the right direction. My background is mainly analysis of metallic aircraft structures. After doing a bit of homework, here's my current reading list: Engineering Mechanics Of Composite Material by Isaac M.

I'm starting a self-learning track of studying physics and engineering. As part of this, I want to learn the higher level physics, and then study applications (engineering) such as orbital mechanics, electronics design, biophysics, etc. But, I'm currently stuck in finding a good textbook (with exposition and problems to work out rather than just a reference) for electronics and computer hardware. This is a sequel to a post I made (https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8334qu/setting_the_score_straight_on_spacex_and_its_many/) nine months ago. This is a significantly more complete and thorough take on the same topic and can be considered to be a replacement for the original. When talking about most of Musk's ventures - the cash-burning Tesla, the lawsuit-ridden SolarCity, or the hopelessly impractical tunnel-digging operations, for example - the problems with these ventures. ##National Intelligence Service: A Better Agent, A Brighter Tomorrow --- --- --- ###Introduction --- --- In 1991, the two primary intelligence agencies in South Korea merged into what is now known as the National Intelligence Service.
